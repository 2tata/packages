This package provides a Lua module with the name 'ethtool_stats'. The module has
a single function, interface_stats().

interface_stats() expects one parameter, the name of the interface to get the
stats from. It returns a table with string keys and numeric values which
contains the stats returned by ethtool (the same `ethtool -S interface` would
yield).
